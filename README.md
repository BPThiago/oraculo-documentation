# DevLake - Installation and Configuration Guide

## Introduction

**DevLake** is a data engineering platform designed to collect, store, and analyze software development data from various tools.

This guide provides detailed instructions to set up and use DevLake in your local environment.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed  
- A **GitHub Access Token** (for GitHub integration)

## Installation

1. Clone the DevLake repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/leds-org/leds-dashboard.git
   cd leds-dashboard
   ```

2. Configure the variables in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` as needed.

3. Generate the `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` using the following command:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -base64 2000 | tr -dc 'A-Z' | fold -w 128 | head -n 1
   ```

4. Start DevLake by running:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start the containers needed to run the DevLake environment.

5. Access the DevLake dashboard at [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).  
   - Use the **username** and **password** configured in `docker-compose.yml` to log in.

Your DevLake environment is now configured and ready to use!

## Data Visualization with Grafana

DevLake uses **Grafana** to display the collected data.

1. Access Grafana at [`http://localhost:4000/grafana`](http://localhost:4000/grafana).  
2. Use the default credentials **admin:admin** to log in (it's recommended to change the password after the first login).  
3. Access Grafanaâ€™s main dashboard:
